        <p id="para1"> <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katrina_Kaif">Katrina kaif</a></b> born <b>Katrina Turquotte</b>; 16 July 1983 is a British actress who primarily works in
            Hindi-language films. </p><br>

        <p> &nbsp; Born in Hong Kong, Kaif lived in several countries before she moved to London. She received her first
            modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. At a fashion show in
            London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad decided to cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial
            failure. While in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career,
            however, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the
            Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine
            Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was
            criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and inclination to male-dominated films.</p><br>

        <p>Her performance in the thriller New York (2009) earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best

            Milegi Dobara (2011), she received her second nomination for her performance in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan
            (2011). Kaif's highest-grossing films came with the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013),
            and Bang Bang! (2014), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. She followed this with a
            series of films which did not perform well commercially, with the exception of the action sequel Tiger Zinda
            Hai (2017) and the drama Bharat (2019), but received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting
            Actress for her portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018).</p><br>

        <h2 style="color: red;">Early life</h2>

        <p>Katrina Kaif was born in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July
            1983.[a][6][7][8] According to the actress, her father, Mohammed Kaif, is a British businessman of Kashmiri
            descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker.[9][10][11] She
            has seven siblings: three elder sisters named Stephanie, Christine and Natasha; three younger sisters named
            Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel; and an elder brother named Michael.[9][11] Isabelle Kaif is also a model and
            actress.[12] Kaif's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father moved to the United States. She
            said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by
            their mother.[6][11][13] On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: "When I see friends who have
            wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead
            of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian
            Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.[11]</p>

        <p>Kaif says that her mother decided to "dedicate her life to social causes", which led to the family's
            relocation to a number of countries for varying lengths of time:</p><br>

        <p> &emsp; Our transitions in growing up were—from Hong Kong where I was born, to China, then to Japan, and from
            Japan by boat to France ... After France, Switzerland—and I'm cutting out many &emsp; East European
            countries where we were for only a few months each—then Poland in Kraków ... After that we went to Belgium,
            then to Hawaii, which was a short time, and then came to &emsp; London.[13]</p><br>

    <h3 style=color:red>Career</h3>
    <p><b> Acting beginnings (2003–2005)</b></p><br>

    <p>At a fashion show Kaif attracted the attention of London-based filmmaker Kaizad Gustad. He selected her for a
        role in the English-Hindi erotic heist film Boom as part of an ensemble cast that included Amitabh Bachchan,
        Gulshan Grover, Jackie Shroff, Madhu Sapre and Padma Lakshmi.[17][18] While filming in India, Kaif received
        other offers and decided to stay in the country.[19] In 2003, she received notice as a model after walking the
        ramp for Rohit Bal at the India Fashion Week[20] and appeared in the first Kingfisher Calendar.[21] Kaif soon
        established a successful modelling career in India after endorsing brands such as Coca-Cola, LG, Fevicol and
        Samsung.[22]</p><br>

    <p>Kaif's career as a model led to anticipation surrounding her Bollywood debut.[18] Boom (2003) had its first
        screening at the Cannes Film Festival, and was heavily promoted at the event.[23][24] Boom was a commercial and
        critical failure.[25][26] Kaif's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly
        received, with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film's leading ladies to "the
        vacuity of their expressions".[27] Hindustan Times reported that after Boom's release, Kaif was written off due
        to her poor Hindi and thick British accent.[28] She later dismissed the film: "I don't count Boom among
        important happenings in my life. When I signed this film, I didn't know much about India and its film
        audience".[29] Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments,[29] filmmakers were hesitant to cast
        her because of her poor command of Hindi.[30] In one instance, Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in
        Saaya (2003) as he found her an "inconsistent performer".[31] Subsequently, Kaif began working on her diction
        through Hindi classes.[29]</p><br>

    <p><b>Breakthrough and rise to prominence (2006–2008)</b></p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Katrina_Kaif-_2006_IIFA_Awards.jpg/277px-Katrina_Kaif-_2006_IIFA_Awards.jpg"
        align="left" height="200">

    <p>In 2006, she appeared with Akshay Kumar for the first of many films in Raj Kanwar's unsuccessful Humko Deewana
        Kar Gaye,[41] a story of two like-minded strangers who fall in love despite being engaged to others. Sify wrote
        that Kaif was "passably competent in a tailor-made role, giving a mild emotional spin to a couple of scenes" but
        was overshadowed by her supporting actresses.[42] Kaif also appeared with Mammootty in the Malayalam crime
        thriller Balram vs. Tharadas,[43] in which Rishi Raj Singh of The Hindu called her performance "marvellous".[44]

        Kaif's career prospects changed in 2007, when she appeared in four Bollywood hits.[45] In an interview with The
        Indian Express, she called Vipul Amrutlal Shah's romantic comedy Namastey London a milestone, saying that "for
        the first time, [she] had a dominating role".[11] Kaif used her life in London as a reference for her role as a
        spoilt British Indian girl intent on marrying her self-centred British boyfriend, despite her parents'
        disapproval.[46] Although critics expressed mixed views on the film,[47] Sukanya Verma wrote that Kaif "suits
        the role to the T" and "brings the zingy mix of her character alive with style and substance".[48] Kaif's
        chemistry with co-star Akshay Kumar was particularly well received, with Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India
        calling their casting "refreshing".[49] Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama mentioned "Katrina is a revelation.
        The actor surprised you with a confident performance in Humko Deewana Kar Gaye and now, in Namaste London, she
        comes up with a spirited performance yet again. She handles the complex part with remarkable ease."[50]</p><br>

    <h3 style="color:red"> <b>New York and widespread recognition (2009–2013)</b> </h3>

    <p>After a string of films in which she was cast to add glamour, Kaif appeared in Kabir Khan's terrorism drama New
        York (2009).[70] Featuring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh in lead roles, the film tells the story of how
        three friends' lives are changed when the former is wrongly detained after 9/11. Kaif played Maya, a college
        student who later marries a terrorist. The actress said that she identified with Maya, since she experienced
        similar isolation because of her skin colour when she was growing up in London.[71] Kaif also remarked that she
        was tired of "arm candy" roles and was looking for more substantial parts.[72] New York did well at the box
        office and received favourable reviews.[73][74] According to Subhash K. Jha, Kaif "comes into her own as an
        actress of substance ... From the carefree effervescent campus girl to the anguished wife, Katrina makes the
        journey look plausible all the way".[75] A reviewer for The Times of India considered it to be the "best
        performance of her entire career."[76] New York brought Kaif her first Filmfare Award nomination for Best
        Actress.[77] She then appeared in a cameo for India's first underwater thriller Blue.[78] Kaif starred with
        Ranbir Kapoor in Rajkumar Santoshi's hit comedy, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), as an orphan forced to marry
        a rich man.[79] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, "Katrina Kaif continues to surprise ... She scores in
        both emotional and light scenes" and called her chemistry with Kapoor "electrifying".[80] Her final film of the
        year was Priyadarshan's comedy De Dana Dan.[72] She performed with Akon at the closing ceremony of the 2009
        Indian Premier League at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg,[81]</p>
